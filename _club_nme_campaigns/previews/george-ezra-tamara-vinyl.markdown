section1-content: "<p>Uninhibited, feel-good new single ‘Paradise’ previews the new\
  \ album and is available now to stream and download Just like Wanted On Voyage,\
  \ Staying At Tamara’s was written, created and inspired by George’s travels, including\
  \ spells on the Isle of Skye; at a pig farm in Norfolk; in a former cornflour shed\
  \ in Kent; a converted cow shed in north Wales; and in an Airbnb in Barcelona owned\
  \ by the Tamara of the album’s title. The result is a finger-snapping, brass-blaring,\
  \ wind-in-the-hair album that shines with positivity and encouragement, alongside\
  \ moments of more subdued reflection.</p>\r\n<p>This album is a MUST! Enter the\
  \ form below for a chance to win and it could be coming home with you! Good luck!</p>"
