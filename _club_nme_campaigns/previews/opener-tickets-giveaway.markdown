section1-content: "<p>Oh yes, it's that time of the year again and we want to officially\
  \ sort your summer festival plans.</p>\r\n<p>We have a pair of tickets for Poland's\
  \ 2018 Open'er Festival to give away to one lucky NME person, plus (because we're\
  \ nice) we'll chuck the camping in gratis.</p>\r\n<p>Pfft, who needs Glastonbury\
  \ when you have a line-up like this?</p>"
section2-content: "Happening at Poland's Gdynia-Kosakowo Airport over a whopping four\
  \ days (4th-7th July 2018), the Open'er Festival has bagged some pretty impressive\
  \ headliners – most of which you'd pay £££ to see here in the UK.."
section3-content: "<p>(Cue shameless name-dropping), Arctic Monkeys, Gorillaz, Depeche\
  \ Mode, Massive Attack and Nick Cave are just some of the major headliners setting\
  \ off our festi-radars across Open'er's three stages – add to that the multitude\
  \ of other acts, an onsite cinema, museum and fashion zone, and you've got the makings\
  \ of a banging summer festival.</p>\r\n<p>Plus, budget airlines such as Ryanair\
  \ fly direct to the festival, so you won't have to drop a wad of cash to get there.</p>\r\
  \n<p>Fancy it? Just complete the form below...</p>"
