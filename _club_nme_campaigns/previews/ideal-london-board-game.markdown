section1-content: "<p>The London Game has a board showing the centre of the innovative\
  \ map of the London Underground, updated over the years as the game was re-issued\
  \ and the Tube developed.</p>\r\n<p>Starting at a mainline terminus, players must\
  \ travel the network, visiting 6 tourist locations on Souvenir cards dealt from\
  \ a deck of 30, stopping at the relevant Tube station and finally returning to their\
  \ starting point. You move from station to station on the roll of the die, but to\
  \ change lines you must stop at junctions and draw a Hazard card. This may move\
  \ you or other players around the board. You may also close stations with a token\
  \ when you leave, to block other players.</p>\r\n<p>If you’re looking for a fun\
  \ night with friends this game is a MUST! Enter the form below and get ready to\
  \ beat your opponent!</p>"
