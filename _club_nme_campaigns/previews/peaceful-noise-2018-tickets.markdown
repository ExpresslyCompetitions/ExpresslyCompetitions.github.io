  \ well underway in a true APN style! Recently making the break to a solo artist\
  \ from The Duke Spirit, Liela Moss will be on hand to hypnotise the audience with\
  \ her emotional, expansive melodies. Plus hotly tipped Sophie and the Giants will\
  \ be putting their own twist on pop.</p>\r\n<p>Compering this incredible line up\
  \ on the night will be Radio X presenter and new music guru, John Kennedy.</p>"
