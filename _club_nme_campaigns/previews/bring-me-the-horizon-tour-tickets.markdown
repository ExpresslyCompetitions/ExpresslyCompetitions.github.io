  s\_The Alchemy Index: Fire and Water and Earth and Air), Thrice took a several-year\
  \ hiatus starting in 2012. Arriving in May 2016,\_To Be Everywhere Is to Be Nowhere\_\
  proved to be Thrice’s most politically-minded yet vulnerable work to date. The band’\

  \ also previously announced that Los Angeles trio FEVER 333 will join the tour as\
