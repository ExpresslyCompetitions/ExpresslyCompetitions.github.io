section1-content: "<p>While it eschews the glammy, pre-punk hard rock of live faves\
  \ like \"Stone Cold Crazy\" and \"Tie Your Mother Down\" for the band's more quirky\
  \ club-beat string of latter-day hits, this 51-track triple-CD anthology goes a\
  \ long way toward documenting the true dimensions of the band's music and fame.\
  \ Some songs may not be instantly familiar to American fans because of yet another\
  \ irony: just as their U.S. fortunes waned during the punk and new wave era, the\
  \ band was exploding into true international superstars.</p>\r\n<p>Thus, there may\
  \ be a sense of discovery here, whether of latter-day Queen material or solo work\
  \ by Brian May and Freddie Mercury, whose duet on \"Barcelona\" with diva Montserrat\
  \ Caball√© transcends boundaries of both time and genre. Think no more and enter\
  \ the form below to win this amazing collection from the amazing band: QUEEN!</>"
