section1-content: "In November 1968, millions of double LPs were shipped to record\
  \ stores worldwide ahead of that tumultuous year’s most anticipated music event:\
  \ the November 22nd release of The BEATLES, The White Album. For 50 years, ‘The\
  \ White Album’ has invited its listeners to venture forth and explore the breadth\
  \ and ambition of its music, delighting and inspiring each new generation in turn."
section2-content: "On November 9, The Beatles will release a suite of lavishly presented\
  \ ‘White Album’ packages (Apple Corps Ltd./Capitol/UMe). The album’s 30 tracks are\
  \ newly mixed by producer Giles Martin and mix engineer Sam Okell in stereo and\
  \ 5.1 surround audio, joined by 27 early acoustic demos and 50 session takes, most\
  \ of which are previously unreleased in any form. This is the first time The BEATLES\
  \  White Album has been remixed and presented with additional demos and session\
  \ recordings."
section3-content: "<p>In order to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the White Album,\
  \ Matt Everitt, will lead a panel of journalists, broadcasters & artists to discuss\
  \ how the White Album influenced a generation of musicians and ask whether in a\

  \ ever dare release such a diverse body of work.</p>\r\n<p>If you don’t want to\
