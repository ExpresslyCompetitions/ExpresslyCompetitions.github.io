section1-content: "<p>Marshall is a true rock legend. That uniquely clear and expressive\
  \ sound combined with a mythical stage presence has enraptured music fans around\
  \ the world for five decades. We’re celebrating the brand’s rich heritage with commemorative\
  \ products that live and breathe Marshall.</p>\r\n</p>The legacy begins in a small\
  \ drum shop in Hanwell in the 1960s, where Jim Marshall sought to give a bunch of\
  \ then-local guitarists the sound they wanted – a sound that was harder, crunchier\
  \ and more rich. The result was the JTM45, an amp that reverberated with a sound\
  \ that was much heavier than anything ever heard before. In a twist of rock and\
  \ roll fate – those guitarists, much like the Marshall name, would go on to revolutionise\
  \ music forever.</p>"
section2-content: "<p>Since launching in 2010, the Major has been Marshall’s best\
  \ selling headphone, with over 2 million units sold. The newest updates to this\
  \ beloved headphone include, new drivers for improved sound characteristics, updated\
  \ ear cushions for comfortable all-day wear, and real vinyl details.</p>\r\n<p>Major\
  \ III comes in a wireless Bluetooth version and a standard wired version to suit\
  \ your listening needs. Both versions are modern classics that have been re-engineered\
  \ for a cleaner, refined design, while the silhouette has stayed true to its original\
  \ form.\r\n</p>"
