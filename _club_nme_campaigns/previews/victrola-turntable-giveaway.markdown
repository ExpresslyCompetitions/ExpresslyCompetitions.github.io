section1-content: "<p>Victrola was born in 1906 in Camden, NJ when first introduced\
  \ to the American public by the Victor Talking Machine Company. Full of entrepreneurial\
  \ ideas and known for its use of quality materials, Victor (later becoming RCA)\
  \ was the largest and most successful turntable manufacturer of its time.</p>\r\n\
  <p>Victrola, much like music, has transcended time and endured the evolution of\
  \ technology. Sleek and modern, sophisticated and timeless or bold and retro, they\
  \ believe a Victrola is more than just a method of listening to music, but a statement.</p>"
section2-content: "<p>The Victrola portable suitcase turntable is an absolute classic\
  \ and loaded with features. Includes built-in Bluetooth technology to wirelessly\
  \ stream music from any Bluetooth enabled device, 3-speed belt driven turntable\
  \ and 3.5mm aux-in jack for playing music from any non-Bluetooth device.</p>\r\n\
  <p>Portable design: just flick the clip on the front, and with the easy carry handle,\
  \ you can take your vinyl anywhere you want. Just plug back in to the mains and\
  \ you’re ready to listen to your favourite vinyl records.</p>"
