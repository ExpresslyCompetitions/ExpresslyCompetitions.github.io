section1-content: "<p>We are more than familiar with Rod Stewart’s singing voice,\
  \ the wonderfully warm rasp that has sound-tracked our lives. He has, of course,\
  \ put his name to more than his share of stone-cold classics: Maggie May, The Killing\
  \ Of Georgie, You Wear It Well, I Was Only Joking…</p>\r\n<p>On Blood Red Roses,\
  \ inspiration has returned in full and the creative juices, and songs, have been\
  \ flowing. The new songs fearlessly address life’s thornier issues from first infatuation\
  \ to our final words to a friend, and all the agonies and ecstasies along the way.</p>\r\
  \n<p>Looking forward to hearing Rod’s songs? Enter the form below for a chance ton\
  \ win and enjoy his lovely warm rasp voice anywhere!</p>"
