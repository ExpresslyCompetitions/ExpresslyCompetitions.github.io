  \ hosted by community members in everyday spaces — from living rooms and rooftops,\
  \ to retail stores. Through the transformation of these spaces into captivating\
  \ venues, Sofar serves as a platform for artists to connect with engaged audiences\
  \ in cities around the world. Sofar invites guests to discover new artists, spaces,\
