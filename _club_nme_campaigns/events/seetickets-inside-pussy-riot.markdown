title: "Inside Pussy Riot at Saatchi Gallery, London"
competition-description: "Here's the true story of what happens to a modern day, post-punk\
  \ feminist art collective group when they stick two fingers up at the Russian system\
  \ and suffer the brutal consequences. Olivier nominated theatre company Les Enfants\
  \ Terribles collaborate with Pussy Riot founder Nadya Tolokonnikova to put you at\
  \ the forefront of an immersive experience that makes you question what price you're\
  \ prepared to pay to stand up for what you believe in.</p> <p>To mark the 100th\
  \ anniversary of the Russian Revolution, coinciding with the Saatchi Gallery's Art\
  \ Riot exhibition, Inside Pussy Riot tells a story that needs to be experienced\
  \ to be understood.</p> <p>Pull on the balaclava, stand in the dock and live the\
  \ realities of imprisonment.</p> <p>Would you sacrifice everything for the sake\
  \ of a punk prayer for a liberal world. Join the revolution. We are all Pussy Riot.\n"
