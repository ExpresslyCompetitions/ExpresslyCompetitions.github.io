section1-content: "<p>The title ‘Spying Through A Keyhole’ is a lyric taken from the\
  \ previously unknown song, Love All Around, and though most of the other titles\
  \ are known, these versions have never been officially released until late last\
  \ year. Most of the recordings are solo vocal and acoustic home demo performances,\
  \ unless otherwise stated.</p><p>The design of each single label is presented to\
  \ reflect the way David sent many of his demos to publishers and record companies,\
  \ featuring his own handwritten song titles on EMIDISC acetate labels. The singles\
  \ themselves are all mono and play at 45 r.p.m.</p>\n<p>Enter the form below for\
  \ a chance to win such a collectors piece! Good luck!</p>\n"
