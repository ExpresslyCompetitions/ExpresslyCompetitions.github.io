section1-content: "<p>Sorry emerged from a thriving scene of bands in London, and\
  \ though 925 is their debut album, it is by no means their first statement. It follows\
  \ a series of mixtapes, released sporadically and used as a way to experiment with\
  \ the disparate influences and sounds that give '925' its distinctively modern and\
  \ apocalyptic sound.</p>\n<p>Where previous singles and mixtapes earned the band\
  \ their status as one of the most vital and relentlessly creative new British bands\
  \ of the moment, '925' is a record which will undoubtedly cement their status as\
  \ true originals and cross-genre innovators in 2020 and beyond.</p>\n"
