section1-content: "</p>As the singer Joe Talbot summarizes: \"This album is an attempt\
  \ to be vulnerable to our audience and to encourage vulnerability; a brave naked\
  \ smile in this shitty new world. We have stripped back the songs and lyrics to\
  \ our bare flesh to allow each other to breathe, to celebrate our differences, and\
  \ act as an ode to communities and the individuals that forge them. Because without\
  \ our community, we'd be nothing.”</p>\n<p>If you can’t wait to listen to The Idles\
  \ brand new hits, enter the form below and it could be yours!</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n"
