	<p>Bored of having your smartphone tell you your storage is full every time you go to take a photo and miss having physical prints to flick through like the good old days?</p>
	<p>The instax range of instant print cameras has long been the solution to these very modern problems – their mini instant cameras have made taking real life photos of your friends, family, holidays and more, a snap.</p>
	<p>Just point and shoot the light, portable camera, and watch as those all important pics develop before your eyes.</p>

	<p>The instax mini 9 is the perfect instant camera. Not only does it come in five cool colours (Cobalt Blue, Ice Blue, Flamingo Pink, Lime Green and Smoky White, FYI), but it’s also got some pretty neat features to help you take even better pictures.</p>
	<p>Check out the selfie mirror next to the lens, which basically makes cutting off half your face in your next festival selfie impossible.</p>
	<p>Then there’s the close-up lens attachment that lets you get the perfect zoom on things up to 35 centimetres away.</p>
