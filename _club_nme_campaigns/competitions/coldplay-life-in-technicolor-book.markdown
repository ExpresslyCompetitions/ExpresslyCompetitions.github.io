section1-content: "<p>Life in Technicolor is the first behind-the-scenes look at one\
  \ of the world's biggest bands. In September 1998, a completely unknown band from\
  \ London performed in the corner of a cafe in Manchester to an audience of fewer\
  \ than ten people. One of these people was Debs Wild, a record company talent scout\
  \ who immediately knew she'd seen the future. To celebrate the band's twentieth\
  \ anniversary, Debs Wild - the discoverer of Coldplay - and Malcolm Croft look back\
  \ on the band's phenomenal rise to glory.</p>\r\n<p>Life In Technicolor: A Celebration\
  \ of Coldplay charts the band's extraordinary history from the very first rehearsal\
  \ right through to the conclusion of their record-breaking A Head Full of Dreams\
  \ Tour. With a unique insider's perspective and never-before-seen photos, this book\
  \ will delight Coldplay's legions of fans across the globe.</p>"
