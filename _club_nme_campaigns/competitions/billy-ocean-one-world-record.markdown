section1-content: "<p>‘One World’ is Billy Ocean first original studio album in over\
  \ 10 years. It’s like a landmark for his 70th birthday. He feels that this album\
  \ reflects his maturity and the many genres of music he has been exposed, coming\
  \ from the Caribbean as a little boy influenced by calypso music, to growing up\
  \ in the East End of London, where music was so wonderfully diverse. He truly feels\
  \ that ‘One World’ has captured all of his musical influences over the years.</p>\n\
  <p>This new album reflects his thoughts, and the way that he feels at 70 years old,\
  \ but most of all he hopes that it will make people stop and think about life and\
  \ its meaning.”</p>\n<p>Click below and it could be yours.</p>\n"
