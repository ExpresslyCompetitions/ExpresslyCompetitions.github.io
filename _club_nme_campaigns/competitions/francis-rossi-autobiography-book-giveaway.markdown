section1-content: "<p>In ‘I Talk Too Much’, Rossi reveals the truth behind one of\
  \ the biggest rock bands of all time, as well as the personal highs and lows of\
  \ a career spanning over 50 years.</p>\n<p>He lifts the lid on the man behind the\
  \ music, from humble beginnings in Forest Hill and being labelled a has-been by\
  \ the press in his twenties to opening Live Aid in 1985 and why he's still going\
  \ strong at seventy. Along the way he has fathered eight children with three mothers\
  \ and beaten both alcoholism and cocaine addiction. Rossi comes clean about the\
  \ time he almost left the band, what he really thinks about the music industry today\
  \ and the complexities of his fifty-year friendship with Rick Parfitt.</p>\n<p>If\
