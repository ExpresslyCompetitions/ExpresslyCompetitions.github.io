section1-content: "<p>Jeffrey Dahmer murdered seventeen men and boys in the Midwest\
  \ United States between 1978 and 1991 before being captured and incarcerated. This\
  \ is the story before that story.</p>\n<p>Jeff Dahmer (Ross Lynch, Disney Channel’\
  s ‘Austin & Ally’) is an awkward teenager who collects roadkill. It’s the end of\
  \ his junior year and he’s practically invisible. His family life (Anne Heche as\
  \ Joyce Dahmer) is coming undone. He fixates on a neighborhood jogger (Vincent Kartheiser,\
  \ ‘Mad Men’) who routinely passes by his house. By the start of senior year, he\
  \ acts out, throwing epileptic-like fits in the halls. His goofball antics win over\
  \ a group of band-nerds who form The Dahmer Fan Club headed by Backderf (Alex Wolff,\
  \ Nickelodeon’s ‘The Naked Brothers Band’). This camaraderie can’t mask his growing\
  \ depravity as approaching graduation Jeff spirals further out of control.</p>\n"
section2-content: "<p>'An absorbing, dramatised portrait of casual cruelty and teenage\
  \ desperation, equal parts ‘The Virgin Suicides’ and ‘The Texas Chain Saw Massacre’\
  <br />\nTIME OUT </p>\n<p>'A chilling insight into the making of a serial killer’\
