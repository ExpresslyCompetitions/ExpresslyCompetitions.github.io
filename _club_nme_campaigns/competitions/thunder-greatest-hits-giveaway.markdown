section1-content: "<p>‘The Greatest Hits’ is a comprehensive, cohesive and career-spanning\
  \ collection, taking in material from every single album since the debut that propelled\
  \ them onto the world stage, 1990’s ‘Backstreet Symphony’ which hit number 21 in\
  \ the charts. That first salvo was followed by ‘Laughing On Judgement Day’ which\
  \ hit No. 2 in 1992, and then ‘Behind Closed Doors’ which was another Top 5 hit\
  \ in 1995.</p>\n<p>‘Greatest Hits’ includes material taken from releases right up\
  \ till 2017’s ‘Rip It Up’ and 2019’s ‘Please Remain Seated’. In fact, the last three\
  \ Thunder albums – ‘Wonder Days’, ‘Rip It Up’ and ‘Please Remain Seated’ have all\
  \ enjoyed UK Top Ten status in the Album Chart. The tracks chosen for ‘The Greatest\
  \ Hits’ shows perfectly the arc of evolution that the band has travelled over three\
  \ decades, developing, challenging themselves and always moving on: without ever\
  \ losing the core elements that make them special. Available in 3CD.</p>\n"
