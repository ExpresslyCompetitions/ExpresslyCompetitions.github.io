section1-content: "<p>No longer riding the novelty of youth, the band deliberately\
  \ took time to recommit to themselves and their craft, and channel new energy into\
  \ their music. Typically opting for a private and insular creation process, the\
  \ friendship between the four saw the band sharing their songs with Chris Walla\
  \ (Death Cab For Cutie), and naturally resulted in Walla co-producing and engineering\
  \ 'Shadow Offering'. Pushing the band out of their comfort zone, he at once broke\
  \ and unified the band's dynamic, unearthing individual creative energy long buried\
  \ over the years.</p>\n<p>Enter below for a chance to win.</p>\n"
