section1-content: "<p>With its pillowy synth-pads and rich textures, this vinyl seamlessly\
  \ wanders through the 80s world of 'Stranger Things', breeding an unthreatening\
  \ serenity with a gentle shift toward a darker mood.</p>\r\n<p>This vinyl is instantly\
  \ reminiscent of works by John Carpenter (Halloween, The Thing), Tangerine Dream\
  \ and Vangelis (Blade Runner), whilst also delving into the ambience of Aphex Twin\
  \ and more modern composers such as Cliff Martinez (Drive, Solaris)</p>\r\n<p>If\
  \ you can’t wait to have this brilliant soundtrack, thanks to NME AAA it could be\
  \ yours! Hurry up! Enter the form below and get ready to immerse yourself into the\
  \ upside down world!</p>\r\n<p>Good luck!</p>"
