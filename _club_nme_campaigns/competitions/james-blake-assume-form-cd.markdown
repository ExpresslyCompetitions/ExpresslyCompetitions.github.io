section1-content: "<p>As unrestricted by genre as it is always underpinned by classic,\
  \ emotionally-open songwriting, James Blake’s new album is arguably his most direct,\
  \ eclectic and pure artistic statement to date. Assume Form also follows a rich\
  \ period of creative and personal evolution for James, who has spoken candidly about\
  \ his experiences of mental health, modern-day masculinity, and finding peace. Even\
  \ the album artwork would appear to represent a fundamental shift for Blake, no\
  \ longer distorted by illustration, landscape or design, but staring right at you\
  \ – and into the future.</p>\r\n<p>Think no more and enter the form below for a\
  \ chance to win James Blake new album, an influence that can be felt throughout\
  \ the modern musical landscape, often hiding in plain sight; allowing the man himself\
  \ – as his fourth album suggests – to always evolve. To never settle. To Assume\
  \ Form.</p>\r\n<p>Good luck!</p>"
