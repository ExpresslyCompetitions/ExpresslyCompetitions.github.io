section1-content: "<p>Set in the heart of one of the world's most dynamic and multicultural\
  \ cities, Gangs of London tells the story of a city being torn apart by the turbulent\
  \ power struggles of the international gangs that control it and the sudden power\
  \ vacuum that's created when the head of London's most powerful crime family is\
  \ assassinated. For 20 years, Finn Wallace (Colm Meaney. Star Trek: TNG, Hell on\
  \ Wheels ) was the most powerful criminal in London. Billions of pounds flowed through\
  \ his organisation each year. But now he's dead and nobody knows who ordered the\
  \ hit.</p>\n<p>Want to know the rest? Click below for a chance to win.</p>\n"
