section1-content: "<p>With all lyrics written by Emeli and working with the likes\
  \ of Salaam Remi, James Poyser and Troy Miller, who produced every song, the album’\
  s 11 tracks act as warm balm for anyone looking for positivity.</p>\n<p>Opening\
  \ track, the compelling Human is a sobering reminder of our vulnerability that sets\
  \ the tone for the record as Sandé sings, “We all human / We all go through things.”\
  \ This is followed by the acoustic guitar lead Love To Help, a poignant and smooth\
  \ statement of solidarity, while on the soaring You Are Not Alone, the singer, flanked\
  \ by the halo of a choir, returns with the anthemic sound that made her a star.\
  \ Building on this momentum is lead single Sparrow, an empowering track that showcases\
  \ the singer’s dynamic voice on top of marching drums, resonant pianos and resplendent\
  \ backing vocals, as does the sermonic Survivor with its flecks of R&B and gospel.\
  \ Honest, a tender piano ballad, sees the singer deliver one of the most emotive\
  \ songs of her career, and the cinematic, string-led Free as a Bird which closes\
  \ the record is timeless. Elsewhere, like on the disco-tinged Extraordinary Being\
  \ and soulful Shine, Emeli pushes her sound further than ever, showcasing the faith\
  \ of a woman and an artist who now truly understands herself..</p>\n<p>Enter below\
  \ for a chance to win a copy of Emeli’s new album. Good luck!</p>\n"
