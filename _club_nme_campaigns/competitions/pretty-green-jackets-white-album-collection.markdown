section1-content: "<p>Pretty Green third Beatles collaboration is finally here and\
  \ they have focused on the legendary White Album. They have used the infamous ‘\
  Mad Day Out’ photo session, shot by Don McCullin on 28th July 1968, as a key reference\
  \ point for the collection. </p><p>McCullin photographed the band at various locations\
  \ around London such as Whitechapel, Old Street and the Sunday Times building on\
  \ Gray’s Inn Road. This new range incorporates key pieces inspired by what the band\
  \ were wearing that day.</p>\n"
section2-content: "<p>By 1968, psychedelia was in full swing and The Beatles were\
  \ still embracing elements of that look, so candy stripes and bright, block colours\
  \ all play a crucial role throughout our collection.</p> <p>They have also added\
  \ their own signature stamp to the range with original hand drawn and painted prints,\
  \ as well as late 60s-influenced bold graphics.</p>\n"
