    <p>There's nothing better than making your music sound really damn good. Sometimes your headphones or computer speakers just don't hack it, and you need a proper good speaker to make everything sound banging; and that's where the SONOS PLAY:1 comes in.</p>
    <p>The speaker is the complete package: petite, convenient and most importantly, it sounds absolutely brilliant.</p>
    <p></p>

section2-content: >
    <p>The attractive mini speaker connects to a phone app which means it's dead easy to pick all your favourite tunes, and although it's on the small size the speaker will fill any sized room. </p>
    <p>Streaming over Wi-Fi, not Bluetooth, it means the music will never stop (even if you have to take a phone call!) and it's fully Amazon Echo compatible. And when it only weighs 1.85 kg, it's dead easy to pop in your bag, or move around your house when you feel the need to feng shui your place.</p>
