section1-content: "<p>Led by singer-songwriter-guitarists Tom Russo, Joe White and\
  \ Fran Keaney, the guitar-pop five-piece returned home to Australia after the relentless\
  \ touring schedule that came following their critically regarded 2018 debut Hope\
  \ Downs. Feeling the literal and metaphorical ground under their feet had shifted,\
  \ the band began grasping for something reliable. For Keaney, that translated into\
  \ writing \"pure romantic fiction\" and consciously avoiding the temptation of angsty\
  \ break-up songs, while Russo looked north to a \"bizarre place\" that captured\
  \ the feeling of manufacturing a sense of home when his own had disappeared.</p>\n"
