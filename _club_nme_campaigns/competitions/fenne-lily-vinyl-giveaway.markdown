section1-content: "<p>Isolation is nothing new for Fenne Lily. In fact, she's written\
  \ an album of songs all about it. It's an expansive, diaristic, frequently sardonic\
  \ record that deals with the mess and the catharsis of entering your 20s and finding\
  \ peace while being alone.</p>\n<p>’Breach’ is a stellar progression overall. Click\
  \ below for a chance to win a copy of it now.</p>\n"
