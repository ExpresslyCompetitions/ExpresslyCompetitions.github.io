section1-content: "<p>The two releases, capture the most compelling, ambitious and\
  \ cohesive creations they’ve ever produced. Eager to break the traditional pop song\
  \ structure which they felt they were becoming increasingly tapered to, the 20 tracks\
  \ defy expectation.</p>\n<p>There are exploratory, progressive-tinged tracks alongside\
  \ atmospheric segues which make the music an experience rather than a mere collection\
  \ of songs. Yet the band’s renowned ability to wield relentless grooves with striking\
  \ power and skyscraper hooks also reaches new heights. </p>\n"
section2-content: "<p>''This is the start of a new era, headlining Glasto is the most\
  \ special show you can do. But it has to be the right time'' Foals told NME in their\
