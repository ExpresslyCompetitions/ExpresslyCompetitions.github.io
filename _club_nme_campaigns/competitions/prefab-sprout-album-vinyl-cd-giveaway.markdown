section1-content: "<p>‘I Trawl The Megahertz’ was conceived and recorded after Paddy\
  \ was diagnosed with a medical condition that seriously affected his vision. Not\
  \ surprisingly the album is a testament to the healing power of music.</p>\r\n<p>The\
  \ album is comprised of nine compositions; the lengthy 22 minute title track, a\
  \ series of shorter instrumental pieces and a couple of songs originally intended\
  \ to accompany a short film.</p>\r\n<p>The track ‘I’m 49’ is one of Paddy’s favourites\
  \ featuring sampled voices. “Musically I like to think of it as Van McCoy on a downer,”\
  \ Paddy says.</p>\r\n<p><i>(Credit:Tom Sheehan)</i></p>"
section2-content: "<p>Though the record originally appeared as a solo album, it seems\
  \ fitting to now classify it as a Prefab Sprout project. “I thought we could do\
  \ anything”, Paddy says of those heady Prefab days. “And Megahertz is true to that\
  \ spirit. The music here is of a piece with everything I’ve ever written. It’s from\
  \ the heart.”</p>\r\n<p>Esprit De Corps, Fall From Grace, Orchid 7… are some of\
  \ the songs you could find at his amazing album. Enter the form below for a chance\
  \ to win and get ready to enjoy Prefab Sprout ‘I Trawl The Megahertz’ album now.</p>\r\
