title: "Win 'Mordechai' by Khruangbin"
competition-description: "<p>Khruangbin has always been multilingual, weaving far-flung\
  \ musical languages like East Asian surf-rock, Persian funk, and Jamaican dub into\
  \ mellifluous harmony. Their third album is finally here and it's speaking out loud.\
  \ It’s a shift that rewards the risk, reorienting Khruangbin’s transportive sound\
  \ toward a new sense of emotional directness, without losing the spirit of nomadic\
  \ wandering that’s always defined it.</p>\n<p>We have one copy to give away to one\
  \ lucky NME AAA member to win. Click below and it could be yours.</p>\n"
