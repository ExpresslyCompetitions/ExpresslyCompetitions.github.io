section1-content: "<p>In 2014 Dan Snaith aka Caribou released Our Love to overwhelming\
  \ critical acclaim and massive fan support. Now Caribou returns with his seventh\
  \ studio album ‘Suddenly’, an album about family and the changes we go though as\
  \ those relationships evolve. Suddenly is the most surprising and unpredictable\
  \ Caribou album to date.</p>\n<p>Though it retains the trademark Caribou warmth\
  \ and technicolour, this album is littered with swerves and left turns, and amazes\
  \ with it’s yet unheard nuances, samples and hooks. As Snaith puts it, “these albums\
  \ are like photo albums for me – when I look back at the old ones, they’re a snapshot\
  \ of my life at that time, full of people who are close to you”. This is the drive\
  \ to continue to make Caribou albums. Full bodies of work where Snaith is able to\
  \ evaluate things, look at those around him and celebrate them. As his passion and\
  \ joy in music making remains as fresh as ever, ‘Suddenly’ is the purest example\
  \ of this yet.</p>\n<p>Enter below for a chance to win it now.</p>\n"
