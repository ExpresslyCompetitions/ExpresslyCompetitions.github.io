section1-content: "<p>The Ox will give readers a never-before-seen glimpse into the\
  \ two very distinct poles of John Entwistle. On the one hand, he was the rock star\
  \ incarnate, being larger than life, self-obsessed to a fault, and proudly and almost\
  \ defiantly so. But beneath this fame and flutter, he was also a man of simple tastes\
  \ and traditional opinions.</p>\n<p>After his untimely death, many of these stories\
  \ were shuttered away into the memories of his family, friends, and loved ones,\
  \ but now, for the first time, The Ox will introduce us to the man behind the myth-the\
  \ iconic and inimitable John Entwistle.</p>\n"
