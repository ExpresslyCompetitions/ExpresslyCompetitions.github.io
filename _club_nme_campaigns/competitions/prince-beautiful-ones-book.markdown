section1-content: "<p>The book is told in four parts. The first is composed of the\
  \ memoir he was writing before his tragic death, pages that brings us into Prince's\
  \ childhood world through his own lyrical prose. The second part takes us into Prince's\
  \ early years as a musician, before his first album released, through a scrapbook\
  \ of Prince's writing and photos. The third section shows us Prince's evolution\
  \ through candid images that take us up to the cusp of his greatest achievement,\
  \ which we see in the book's fourth section: his original handwritten treatment\
  \ for Purple Rain?the final stage in Prince's self-creation, as he retells the autobiography\
  \ we've seen in the first three parts as a heroic journey.</p>\n<p>This work is\
  \ not just a tribute to Prince, but an original and energizing literary work, full\
  \ of Prince’s ideas and vision, his voice and image, his undying gift to the world.</p>\n"
