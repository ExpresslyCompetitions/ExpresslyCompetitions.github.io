title: "Win Clint Eastwood ‘The Mule’ on Blu-ray!"
competition-description: "<p>Clint Eastwood is back with a brand new movie you wont\
  \ want to miss: The Mule. Starred as Earl Stone, a man in his 80s who is broke,\
  \ alone, and facing foreclosure of his business when he is offered a job that simply\
  \ requires him to drive. Easy enough, but, unbeknownst to Earl, he's just signed\
  \ on as a drug courier for a Mexican cartel. He does well-so well, in fact, that\
  \ his cargo increases exponentially, and Earl is assigned a handler.<p>\n<p>Want\
  \ to know more? Click below for a chance to win.</p>\n"
