section1-content: "<p>'Live 1969' showcases this incredibly, important phase in Elvis's\
  \ career in definitive detail - his first live shows following his triumphant, 1968\
  \ comeback for NBC after an 8-year absence from playing live. This box set features\
  \ 11 complete sets from the first of his many engagements at The International Hotel\
  \  allowing fans a more definitive picture of The King's glorious return to the\
  \ concert stage. The accompanying 52-page book includes rare photos, memorabilia\
  \ and an oral history by Ken Sharp curated from historic interviews with Elvis,\
  \ Colonel Tom Park, Tom Jones and more.</p>\n<p>After years of increasingly worse\
  \ movies and diminishing record sales, he had just managed to turn his career around\
  \ with his 1968 TV special. This show demonstrates all the charm and charisma of\
  \ Elvis and his great, new band, combining repertoire of mainly blues-tinged rock\
  \ 'n' roll, with a few beautiful ballads and his two, new, hit singles, 'In the\
  \ Ghetto' and 'Suspicious Minds'. Recorded at the 2,000-seater showroom of the International,\
  \ the intimate setting also gave Elvis the opportunity to talk to his audience,\
  \ cracking jokes and telling a 10-minute story of his career, giving a rare insight\
  \ to an otherwise very private man.</p>\n"
