section1-content: "<p>For the album Kesha enlisted an eclectic roster of collaborators,\
  \ songwriters and producers, including John Hill, Dan Reynolds, Stuart Crichton\
  \ & many more.</p>\n<p>The emotional and stylistic range found on the album is a\
  \ blend of heavenly highs and emotional depths. Kesha's swagger is front and centre,\
  \ paired with brilliant kiss-off one-liners, dancefloor grooves, and reminders to\
  \ pay the haters no mind. Frisky, rap-based tracks show-off her skills as a lyrical\
  \ spitfire, while elsewhere on the album a folkier side emerges. With a dream-pop\
  \ ode to a best friendship, a reflective ballad about growing up without a father,\
  \ and plenty of lust and laughter, 'High Road' traverses the emotional spectrum.</p>\n"
