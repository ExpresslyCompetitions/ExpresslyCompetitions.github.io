  \ the 'London' poem written by Arlo Parks. Also the artwork sleeve are both front\
  \ and back created by Arlo Parks. The vinyl includes her song'Sophie'. A song about\
  \ 'crumbling under expectations and feeling helpless, but with a persistent, quiet\
  \ sense of hope underpinning it'. True to form, it's a melodic and beautifully articulated\
  \ sonnet, cementing the notion that she is overwhelmingly considered the majestic\
  \ voice of Generation Z.</p>\n"
