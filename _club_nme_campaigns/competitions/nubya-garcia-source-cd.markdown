section1-content: "<p>'Source' is fundamentally about getting grounded within yourself,\
  \ so that you can be present with others. It's about a realisation of personal and\
  \ collective power: the evolution of the saxophonist's values as she re-connects\
  \ with herself, her roots and her community.</p>\n<p>Garcia digs deep to present\
  \ an album with a global outlook: from London to Bogota, Caura to Georgetown, it's\
  \ a record drawing inspiration from the many places Garcia calls home.</p>\n"
