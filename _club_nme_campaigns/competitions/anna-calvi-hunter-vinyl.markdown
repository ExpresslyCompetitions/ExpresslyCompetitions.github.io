section1-content: "<p>Produced by Nick Launay, the album was recorded with Anna's\
  \ band with the addition of Adrian Utley and Martyn Casey. It has a new rawness,\
  \ a primal energy into which Calvi pushes the limits of her guitar and voice beyond\
  \ anything she's recorded before. Hunter is the embodiment of the feeling of truly\
  \ letting go. For the songwriter and virtuosic guitarist, it was a catharsis, an\
  \ opportunity to be more truthful than ever.</p>\n<p>In her brand new album she\
  \ wanted to express herself while being free from the story that either gender is\
  \ given and free from worrying how people would judge her. Click below for a chance\
  \ to win it now.</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n"
