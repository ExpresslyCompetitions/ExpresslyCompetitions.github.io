section1-content: "<p>Sonically constructed to capture the feeling of a hip-hop record\
  \ (including production contribution from Kenny Beats), the album doubles down on\
  \ the vitriolic sneer and blunt social commentary of their past work. Not far beneath\
  \ the surface of their self-admitted sloganeering lies a deeply complex and brutally\
  \ relevant album that chews up clich√©s and spits them out as high art for the masses.</p>\n\
  <p>This is momentary acceptance of the self. This is Ultra Mono. Click below and\
  \ it could be yours.</p>\n"
