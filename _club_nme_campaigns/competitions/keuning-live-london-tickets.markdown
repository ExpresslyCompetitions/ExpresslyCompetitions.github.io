section1-content: "<p>More than 17 years have passed since Iowa transplant Dave Keuning\
  \ placed an ad in the local Las Vegas Weekly looking to form a band, mentioning\
  \ Oasis as one of his faves.\_ An eager 20-year-old named Brandon Flowers, who shared\
  \ Keuning’s love of groups like New Order and the Cure, answered it, only to have\
  \ Dave promptly hand him a TASCAM-recorded four-track demo of “Mr. Brightside.”\
  </p>\r\n<p>The result was the formation of The Killers, who have released five consecutive\
  \ chart-topping albums and toured the world thanks to a songwriting partnership\
  \ which molded such hits as “Somebody Told Me,” “When You Were Young,” “Read My\
  \ Mind,” “A Dustland Fairy Tale,” “The World We Live In” and “Spaceman,” among others.</p>\r\

section2-content: "<p>Now, the founding member and guitarist from The Killers has\
  \ released his new single ‘Boat Accident’, taken from Keuning’s debut album Prismism.</p>\r\
  \n<p>Prismism is the result, a collection of 14 tracks – with all the instruments,\
  \ save some drum parts, played by Keuning himself – which, like the title says,\
  \ sees things from all sides, focusing on details without missing the big picture.\
  \ The album examines our basic relationships and interactions, with family, friends\
  \ and co-workers, how one can feel trapped by their surroundings, as well as those\
  \ that rely on them, emotionally and/or professionally. The album is inspired by\
  \ the very thing that brought him here in the first place – the music.</p>"
section3-content: "<p>Keuning plays his debut solo UK shows next month showcasing\
  \ his brand new material, with a date at Manchester’s Night & Day on 9th December\
  \ and London’s Dingwalls on 10th December.</p>\r\n<p>We’ve got a pair of tickets\
  \ to see the incredible Keuning live at London’s Dingwalls on December 10th and\
