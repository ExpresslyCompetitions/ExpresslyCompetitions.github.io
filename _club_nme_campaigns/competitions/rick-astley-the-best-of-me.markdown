section1-content: "<p>The set is bookended with a step into the past and an eye to\
  \ the future. Again entirely self-written, produced and performed, opening track\
  \ 'Every One of Us' is a brand new song that shows that the power of Rick Astley\
  \ 2.0 is undiminished. And it closes with a new 'Pianoforte' take on 'Never Gonna\
  \ Give You Up'. Dropping the peppy '80s beats for an intimate piano arrangement\
  \ captures it in a new light, its inner heartbreak becoming all the more apparent.</p>\n\
  <p>Want it? We are giving away a copy of Rick Astley’s brand new record ‘The Best\
  \ Of Me’ to one lucky member. Think no more and enter below for a chance to taking\
  \ it home with you.</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n"
