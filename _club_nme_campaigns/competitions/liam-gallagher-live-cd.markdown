  \ greats (Paul McCartney, Page and Plant, Nirvana and many more) who have filmed\

  \ on his own terms.</p>\n<p>The show’s electrifying atmosphere is palpable from\
  \ the very beginning with a phenomenal reaction as Liam takes to the stage with\
  \ ‘Wall of Glass’. Click below for a chance to take it home with you now.</p>\n"
