section1-content: "<p>Black Honey are quite Lush-ish. You might even say they're Lush-ous,\
  \ only a bit classicist, less 4AD than Telstar. They blend, or rather create a burning\
  \ pyre out of, girl-group pop and shoegazing guitar noise. They are fans equally\
  \ of FX pedals and the lasting impact of a simple melody.</p>\n<p>Enter the form\
  \ below for a chance to win Black Honey's cd album and discover more about the group\
