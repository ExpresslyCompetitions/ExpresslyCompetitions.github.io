section1-content: "<p>‘Face It’ upends the standard music memoir while delivering\
  \ a truly prismatic portrait. With all the grit, grime, and glory recounted in intimate\
  \ detail, it recreates the downtown scene of 1970s New York City, where Blondie\
  \ played alongside the Ramones, Television, Talking Heads, Iggy Pop and David Bowie.</p>\n\
  <p>Following her path from glorious commercial success to heroin addiction, the\
  \ near-death of partner Chris Stein, a heart-wrenching bankruptcy, and Blondie’\
  s break-up as a band to her multifaceted acting career in more than thirty films,\
  \ a stunning solo career and the triumphant return of her band, and her tireless\
  \ advocacy for the environment and LGBTQ rights, ‘Face It’ is a cinematic story\
  \ of a woman who made her own path, and set the standard for a generation of artists\
  \ who followed in her footsteps – a memoir as dynamic as its subject.</p>\n"
