section1-content: "<p>This powerful appliance can function as a blender, a grinder,\
  \ a juicer and an ice crusher, making it extremely versatile and helpful around\
  \ the kitchen. When you make your own drinks, soups, shakes etc., you have more\
  \ control over what ingredients you add and can therefore make them more healthy,\
  \ and cheaper, than shop bought versions.</p>\n<p>Use the jug to make enough to\
  \ fill the drinking cups included or transfer contents to your own drinking bottle\
  \ to take to the gym or office. You can also use this machine to grind coffee beans\
  \ and spices etc., for use in home cooking.</p> \n<p>Think no more and enter the\
  \ form below for a chance to win the best gift you could ever asked for! Good luck!</p>\n"
