section1-content: "<p>The fact that there is a dare on the line can make things really\
  \ tense, will it be you? However, the game alone is superb and is fun to play without\
  \ there being a dare on the line. There's no perfect strategy to SH!THEAD, every\
  \ game is unique, so it's strongly recommended you play a few hands to get the hang\
  \ of it before risking it all with a dare.</p>\n<p>There are 52 dares in the pack\
  \ ranging from hilarious and silly to courageous and brave. All of the dares within\
  \ this pack are able to be attempted instantly, no expense is needed to achieve\
  \ them.</p>\n<p>Donâ€™t forget SH!THEAD is not about winning. SH!THEAD is about not\
  \ losing. Enter below for a chance to win it now!</p>\n"
