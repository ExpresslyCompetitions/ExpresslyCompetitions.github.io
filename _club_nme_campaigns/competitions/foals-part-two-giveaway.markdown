  \ emerged as an immediate album of the year contender, with many hailing it as the\
  \ finest moment in a consistently critically-acclaimed career. That status was cemented\
  \ when it was shortlisted for the Mercury Prize last week. Now Foals complete that\
  \ artistic statement with 'Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost - Part 2'. The album\
  \ has been launched with the lead track 'Black Bull'.</p>\n<p>Enter below for a\
