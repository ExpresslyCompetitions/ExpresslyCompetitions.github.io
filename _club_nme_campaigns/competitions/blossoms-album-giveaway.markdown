section1-content: "<p>'Foolish Loving Spaces' is the follow-up to Blossoms' 2018 album\
  \ 'Cool Like You' and features the single 'Your Girlfriend'. The album was produced\
  \ by the band's consistent and talented team of James Skelly and Rich Turvey at\
  \ Parr Street Studios in Liverpool.</p>\n<p>Tom Ogden's increasingly direct lyrical\
  \ range turns album three into a romantic page-turner of light and shade, while\
  \ its divergent moods are supplied by Myles Kellock's piano and keyboard lines,\
  \ careering from urgent stabs of TV game show-theme synth to more classic, rolling\
  \ notes.</p>\n<p>The record's multi-instrumental colour and widescreen sound is\
  \ provided by pedal steel/lead guitarist Josh Dewhurst, while Joe Donovan on drums\
  \ and Charlie Salt on bass bring fluidly danceable grooves throughout, complemented\
  \ on occasion by a wall of gospel harmony.</p>\n"
