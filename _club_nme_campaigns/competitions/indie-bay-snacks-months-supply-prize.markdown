section1-content: "<p>Two years ago Indie Bay’s founder, Dafna, found herself in an\
  \ all too familiar situation. A house full of hungry teenagers, an empty snack drawer,\
  \ and a trip to the shops only to be met with shelves of fried crisps and sugary\
  \ treats.</p>\r\n<p>There had to be something that could satisfy savoury cravings,\
  \ without leaving us feeling guilty? Dafna decided to create a snack that everyone\
  \ - young and old - could enjoy; a better, smarter way to snack. With that in mind:\
  \ Indie Bay Snacks was born.</p>"
section2-content: "<p>These are a bit like pretzels but better: better shape, better\
  \ taste and better ingredients. The knot shaped pretzel has made way for crunchier,\
  \ round pretzels that deliver on texture but won’t break apart when you stuff them\
  \ in your gym bag!</p>\r\n<p> Made using alternative flours like spelt and quinoa,\
  \ these crunchy, satisfying bites are a delicious source of fibre and protein. As\
  \ well as containing fewer than 100 calories per portion, they’re also vegan, with\
  \ no artificial colours or flavours!</p>"
section3-content: "<p>If you can’t wait to try this amazing range of tasty snacks,\
  \ complete the form below and you could be taking home a month’s supply of Indie\
  \ Bay Snacks PLUS a tote, a lanyard & a card holder!</p>\r\n<p>Good luck!</p>"
