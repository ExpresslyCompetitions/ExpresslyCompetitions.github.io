section1-content: "<p>Phoebe Bridgers presents her sophomore solo album, 'Punisher',\
  \ released on Dead Oceans. Bridgers is a singular talent, and also the rare artist\
  \ with enough humor to deconstruct the tired heuristics of a meteoric rise. 'Punisher',\
  \ written and recorded between the summer of 2018 and the fall of 2019, cements\
  \ her as one of the most irresistibly clever and tenderly prolific songwriters of\
  \ our era.</p>\n<p>Returning to work with her Stranger In The Alps collaborators\
  \ Tony Berg and Ethan Gruska, Bridgers - who co-produced the boygenius EP and Better\
  \ Oblivion Community Center album - stepped into the role of co-producer for Punisher\
  \ and has drawn from the same tight-knit group of musicians who appeared on her\
  \ debut as well as those she has worked with since.</p>\n"
