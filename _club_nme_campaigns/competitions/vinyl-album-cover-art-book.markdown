section1-content: "<p>Founded in 1967 by Storm Thorgerson, Aubrey ‘Po’ Powell and\
  \ Peter Christopherson, Hipgnosis gained legendary status in graphic design, transforming\
  \ the look of album art forever and winning five Grammy nominations for package\
  \ design.</p>\n<p>Their revolutionary cover art moved away from the conventional\
  \ group shots favoured by record companies of the day, resulting in the ground-breaking,\
  \ often surreal designs which define the albums of many of the biggest names in\
  \ the history of popular music: 10cc, AC/DC, Black Sabbath, Peter Gabriel, The Police,\
  \ Genesis, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Paul McCartney, Robert Plant, Syd Barrett,\
  \ Throbbing Gristle, T. Rex, Wings, Yes and XTC, to name but a few. </p>\n<p>It\
  \ also features stunning reproductions of every single Hipgnosis cover, 372 in total.\
