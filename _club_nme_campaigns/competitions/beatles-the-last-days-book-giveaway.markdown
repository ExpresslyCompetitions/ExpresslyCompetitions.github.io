  \ a final chapter reconstructing for the first time the seismic events of 1969,\
  \ the year that saw the band reach new highs of musical creativity and new lows\
  \ of internal strife. Two years after Flower Power and the hippie idealism of the\
  \ Summer of Love, the Sixties dream had perished on the vine.</p>\n<p>By 1969, violence\
  \ and vindictiveness had replaced the Beatles' own mantra of peace and love, and\
  \ Vietnam and the Cold War had supplanted hope and optimism. And just as the decade\
  \ foundered on the altar of a cold, harsh reality, so too did the Beatles.In the\
  \ midst of this rancour, however, emerged the disharmony of Let It Be and the ragged\
  \ genius of Abbey Road, their incredible farewell love letter to the world.</p>\n\
