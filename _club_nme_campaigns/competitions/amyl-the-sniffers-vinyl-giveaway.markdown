section1-content: "<p>The debut album from Amyl and the Sniffers is the sound of 21st\
  \ century Australia recorded in Sheffield with producer Ross Orton.</p>\n<p>It's\
  \ primal and explosive with a love of glam, the '70s Sharpie movement and good time\
  \ rock 'n' roll backed with lyrics that somehow are simultaneously bleak and nihilistic,\
  \ yet humorous and celebratory. The album is full of beefy riffs and stomping drums\
  \ that rage and roll and live up to all the hype. It has attitude, sass and Amy's\
  \ sore throat howl.</p>\n<p>Enter the form below for a chance to win it now!</p>\n"
