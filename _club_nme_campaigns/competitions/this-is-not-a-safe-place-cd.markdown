  \ reunite with revered DJ, producer and remixer Erol Alkan, who was on production\
  \ duties for 2017's 'Weather Diaries'. Rekindling that creative partnership has\
  \ once again seen Ride push their sound forward, as hypnotic rhythms and washes\
  \ of lush guitars come together with leftfield electronic influences. The combination\
  \ creates a sound rich in their trademark shoegaze atmosphere, whilst simultaneously\
  \ sounding fresh and creatively ambitious!</p>\n<p>Want to add it to your collection?\
