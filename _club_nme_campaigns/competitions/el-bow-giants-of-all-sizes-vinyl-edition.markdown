title: "Win El Bow 'Giants Of All Sizes' vinyl edition!"
competition-description: "<p>'Giants Of All Sizes' is the eighth studio album by the\
  \ English alternative rock group El Bow. This brand new record is an angry, old\
  \ blue lament which finds its salvation in family, friends, the band and new life.\
  \ It's a record that lyrically takes in moments of deep personal loss whilst reflecting\
  \ its times by confronting head-on the spectres of injustice and division not just\
  \ in the UK but across the world. It is a record that could only have been made\
  \ in the 21st Century.</p>\n<p>We are giving away a copy of El Bow's brand new album\
  \ on vinyl edition to one lucky NME AAA member to win. Click below and it could\
  \ be yours!</p>\n"
