section1-content: "<p>Ennio Morricone anthologies come and go, and there are always\
  \ several to choose from. But as so many recycle the same tracks, one might be forgiven\
  \ for thinking Morricone had only scored a dozen or so movies rather than something\
  \ over 300. This makes picking a collection difficult, but this disc can be recommended\
  \ for particularly polished remastered sound and, with 20 tracks, a lengthy 75 minutes'\
  \ playing time.</p>\n<p>Click below for a chance to win.</p>\n"
