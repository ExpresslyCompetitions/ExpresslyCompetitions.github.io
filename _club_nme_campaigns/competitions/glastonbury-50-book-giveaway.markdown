section1-content: "<p>Glastonbury 50 is the authorised, behind-the-scenes, inside\
  \ story of the music festival that has become a true global phenomenon. The story\
  \ begins in 1970. The day after Jimi Hendrix's death... dairy farmer Michael Eavis\
  \ invites revellers to his field in Somerset to attend a 'Pop, Folk & Blues' festival.\
  \ Fast forward through five tumultuous decades and the Eavis's vision now encompasses\
  \ a gigantic 'city in the fields', with a total annual population nearing a quarter\
  \ of a million.</p>\n<p>In their own words, Michael and Emily Eavis reveal the stories\
  \ behind the headlines, and celebrate 50 years of history in the Vale of Avalon.\
  \ They're joined by artists - Stanley Donwood, Kurt Jackson and many more. Writers\
  \ - Caitlin Moran, Lauren Laverne, Billy Bragg - and by a host of photographers,\
  \ from Seventies icon Brian Walker to rock and roll legends Jill Furmanovsky and\
  \ Greg Williams.</p>\n<p>Together they bring you the magic that makes Glastonbury,\
  \ Glastonbury.</p>\n"
