section1-content: "<p>Challenging each other is the core of their songwriting partnership.\
  \ It’s these risks and experiments that make ‘Forever Turned Around’ a triumph.\
  \ Restlessness is at the heart of Whitney’s resonant and stunning sophomore album\
  \ Forever Turned Around. As Ehrlich and Kakacek realized life can change almost\
  \ instantly. Priorities shift, relationships evolve, home can become far away, and\
  \ even when luck momentarily works out, there’s still that underlying search for\
  \ something better. Happiness can be fleeting but this album proves that even when\
  \ it feels like time is turning on its head and there’s either a moment of clarity\
  \ or crippling doubt, there’s still beauty in figuring it all out.</p>\n<p>Think\
  \ no more and enter below for a chance to win this great album now.</p>\n"
