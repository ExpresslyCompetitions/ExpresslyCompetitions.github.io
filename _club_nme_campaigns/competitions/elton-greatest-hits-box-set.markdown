section1-content: "<p>Greatest Hits 1970-2002 is the first attempt to consolidate\
  \ all of Sir Elton's hit singles, from three different labels, in one collection.\
  \ It once would've required at least four different CDs to own the best stuff here.\
  \ Popular wisdom dictates that the legendary performer was at his best in the early\
  \ to mid-1970s, and the incredible string of singles that ran from 1970's \"Your\
  \ Song\" through 1977's \"Sorry Seems To Be the Hardest Word\" remains mightily\
  \ impressive. But in retrospect, as presented here, 1980s hits such as \"I'm Still\
  \ Standing\" and \"Sad Songs\" add much to an already amazing legacy.</p>\n<p>Three\
  \ Disney tunes, the lush \"The One\", and two from Songs from the West Coast, which\
  \ was hailed as a return to those golden days, represent the later years.</p>\n"
