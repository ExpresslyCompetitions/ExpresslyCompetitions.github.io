section1-content: "<p>Restless Minds (out Feb 8th), the follow-up to 2016’s chart-topping\
  \ Cartwheels, finds the Hampshire sisters on scorching form. Observational and opinionated,\
  \ it documents their coming of age in an era of anxiety and the impact of social\
  \ media on a generation for which ‘the truth’ has become a tenuous term.</p>\r\n\
  <p>There are songs on the album which touch on women in the workplace and #MeToo,\
  \ others explore mental health issues and a couple relate to their own relationship\
  \ as twins growing up and growing apart.</p>"
section2-content: "<p>Restless Minds is every bit as bold. While Cartwheels saw Ward\
  \ Thomas reach beyond the so-called UK country of From Where We Stand, the DIY debut\
  \ they made in their teens, Restless Minds goes far further. Country influences\
  \ still surface on some songs, far less on others. Harmonies still play a large\
  \ part, but both pushed themselves solo to adapt to punchier sounds.</p><p>Ward\
  \ Thomas worked with a host of pop writer/producers, as well as previous collaborators\
  \ including longtime friends Jessica Sharman and Rebekah Powell, Cartwheels producer\
  \ Martin Terefe, people like Ed Drewett (One Direction, Little Mix) and many more.</p>"
section3-content: "<p>Restless Minds was written between London, Nashville and Hampshire,\
  \ where Ward Thomas borrowed a thatched cottage with a piano from a family friend\
  \ and locked themselves away with co-writers to drink tea, eat scones, open up about\
  \ their feelings and sometimes write songs, up to three a day when the scones finally\
  \ ran out.</p><p>If you want to hear all the brand new hits from the talented Ward\
  \ Thomas, here’s your chance to win their brand new album ‘Restless Minds’ on vinyl\
  \ edition and cd! Enter the form below and it could be yours! Good luck!</p>"
