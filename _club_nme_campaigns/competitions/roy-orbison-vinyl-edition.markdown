  \ like “Blue Bayou,” “The Crowd” and “Crawling Back,” but fan favorites like “Heartbreak\
  \ Radio” plus “California Blue,” “Danny Boy” and “Walk On,” three tracks that were\
  \ included after Roy’s estate reached out to fans for their feedback.</p> \n<p>Additionally,\
  \ the album will feature instrumental backing from “Roy’s boys”: his three sons\
  \ Wesley, Roy Jr. (on guitars) and Alex (playing drums). The album also features\
  \ backing vocals on eight tracks from the “Orbison girls”: Emily Orbison (Wesley’\
  s daughter), Jen Hicks (Wesley’s fiancé), Åsa Orbison (Roy Jr.’s wife) and Erika\
  \ Wolf Orbison (Alex’s wife – their forthcoming daughter kicks along to the beat\
  \ as well). Tracks like “Unchained Melody” and “Heartbreak Radio” feature as many\
  \ as eight Orbisons, counting Roy himself.</p>\n<p>Enter the form below for a chance\
