section1-content: "<p>Cliff Richard tells his story, in his own words, in his highly\
  \ anticipated new autobiography. Achieving a hit in every decade since the 1950s,\
  \ Cliff Richard stands alone in pop history. Coming of age in 1950s London, he began\
  \ his music career at Soho's legendary 2i's Cafe, and now he's approaching his 80th\
  \ birthday with record sales of over 250m and counting.</p>\n<p>Cliff Richard was\
  \ a pioneer, forging the way for British rock 'n' roll with his unique sound. The\
  \ original British teen idol, his incredible story takes us into the studio of TV's\
  \ first pop show Oh Boy!, through 40 years of Top of the Pops, and playing live\
  \ up and down the country and across the world, with a constant backdrop of screaming\
  \ fans.</p>\n</p>Cliff looks back on his humble upbringing, and how he went on to\
  \ fulfil his wildest dreams by becoming a pop star and even a film star. He talks\
  \ about finding Christianity, reflects on the ups and downs of life in the public\
  \ eye, and reveals how the false allegations against him changed his life forever.\n\
  He's seen era-defining pop stars come and go, and he's still making new music, with\
  \ a new project to be released this year. As a teenage Elvis-fan in Cheshunt, this\
  \ may have seem a distant dream. Here's his story of how he made it all happen.</p>\n"
