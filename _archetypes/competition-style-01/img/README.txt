| Suggested Name | Recommended Size |  Description |
| -------------- | -------------  | ---------- |
| header-img.png | 1920 x 1080 | The hero background image |
| first-img.png | 960 x 720 | The image for the first section |
| second-img.png | 960 x 720 | The image for the second section |
| {giver-name}-logo.png | n x 64 | The logo for the giver / publisher |
| {taker-name}-logo.png | n x 64 | The logo for the taker / advertiser |
