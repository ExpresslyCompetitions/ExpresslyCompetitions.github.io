section1-content: "<p>‘Seven Days Walking’: seven bodies of music to be released over\
  \ seven consecutive months. Inspiration for the entire project derived from walks\
  \ that Einaudi would take through the mountains in winter. He explains, \"In January\
  \ last year I often went for long walks in the mountains, always following more\
  \ or less the same trail. It snowed heavily, and my thoughts roamed free inside\
  \ the storm, where all shapes, stripped bare by the cold, lost their contours and\
  \ colours. Perhaps that feeling of extreme essence was the origin of this album.”\
  </p>\n<p>The first album focuses on several main themes, which then recur in different\
  \ forms on the following albums, seven variations following the same imaginary itinerary.\
  \ Or the same itinerary, retraced at seven different times.</p>\n<p>Enter the form\
  \ below for a chance to win Ludovico Einaudi’s work of art now.</p>\n"
