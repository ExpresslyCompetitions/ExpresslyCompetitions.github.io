section1-content: "<p>What once seemed Queen's greatest liabilities a preening flamboyance\
  \ and pompous, overwrought theatricality have ironically become their most enduring\
  \ charms in a gray, postmodern pop-music landscape.</p>\n<p>While it eschews the\
  \ glammy, pre-punk hard rock of live faves like \"Stone Cold Crazy\" and \"Tie Your\
  \ Mother Down\" for the band's more quirky club-beat string of latter-day hits,\
  \ this 51-track triple-CD anthology goes a long way toward documenting the true\
  \ dimensions of the band's music and fame. Some songs may not be instantly familiar\
  \ to American fans because of yet another irony: just as their U.S. fortunes waned\
  \ during the punk and new wave era, the band was exploding into true international\
  \ superstars.</p>\n<p>Thus, there may be a sense of discovery here, whether of latter-day\
  \ Queen material or solo work by Brian May and Freddie Mercury, whose duet on \"\
  Barcelona\" with diva Montserrat Caball√© transcends boundaries of both time and\
  \ genre. Think no more and enter the form below to win this amazing collection from\
  \ the amazing band: QUEEN!</>\n"
