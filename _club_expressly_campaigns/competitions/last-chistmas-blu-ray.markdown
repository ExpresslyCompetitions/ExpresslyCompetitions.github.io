section1-content: "<p>Kate (Emilia Clarke) harumphs around London, a bundle of bad\
  \ decisions accompanied by the jangle of bells on her shoes, another irritating\
  \ consequence from her job as an elf in a year-round Christmas shop. Tom (Henry\
  \ Golding) seems too good to be true when he walks into her life and starts to see\
  \ through so many of Kate’s barriers. As London transforms into the most wonderful\
  \ time of the year, nothing should work for these two. But sometimes, you gotta\
  \ let the snow fall where it may, you gotta listen to your heart … and you gotta\
  \ have faith.</p>\n"
