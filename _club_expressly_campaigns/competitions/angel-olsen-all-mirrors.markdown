section1-content: "<p>The descent into darkness is a trope we find time again across\
  \ history, literature and film. But there’s also an abyss above. There’s a winding\
  \ white staircase that goes ever upward into the great unknown — each step, each\
  \ turn, requiring a greater boldness and confidence than the one before. This is\
  \ the journey on which we find Angel Olsen.</p>\n<p>In ‘All Mirrors’, we can see\
  \ her taking an introspective deep dive towards internal destinations and revelations.\
  \ In the process of making this album, she found a new sound and voice, a blast\
  \ of fury mixed with hard won self-acceptance. Olsen said. “Finding the capacity\
  \ for new love and trusting change, even when you feel like a stranger. This is\
  \ a record about facing yourself and learning to forgive what you see. It is about\
  \ losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people. It is about walking away from\
  \ the noise and realizing that you can have solitude and peace in your own thoughts,\
  \ that your thoughts alone can be just as valid, if not more.”</p>\n"
