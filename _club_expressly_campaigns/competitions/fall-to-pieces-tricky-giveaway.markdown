section1-content: "<p>'Fall To Pieces' is Tricky’s 14th studio album. It was recorded\
  \ in Tricky's Berlin studio in late 2019. Tricky is keen to point out that the tracks\
  \ on the record can be deceptive; often short, ending abruptly and moving on to\
  \ the next without warning. Although instrumentation varies from bursts of tense\
  \ synths, distorted dial tones, and samples, the song's lyrics can be dark and dense.</p>\n\
