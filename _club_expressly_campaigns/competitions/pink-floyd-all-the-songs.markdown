section1-content: "<p>Organized chronologically by album, this massive, 544-page hardcover\
  \ begins with their 1967 debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, the only one\
  \ recorded under founding member Syd Barrett's leadership; through the loss of Barrett\
  \ and the addition of David Gilmour; to Richard Wright leaving the band in 1979\
  \ but returning; to Roger Waters leaving in 1985 and the albums recorded since his\
  \ departure, including their 2014 farewell album, The Endless River, which was downloaded\
  \ 12 million times on Spotify the week it was released.</p>\r\n<p>Packed with more\
  \ than 500 photos, All the Songs is also filled with stories fans treasure, such\
  \ as Waters working with engineer Alan Parsons to employ revolutionary recording\
  \ techniques for The Dark Side of the Moon at Abbey Road Studios in 1972 or producer\
  \ Bob's Ezrin's contribution in refining Water's original sprawling vision for The\
  \ Wall.</p>"
