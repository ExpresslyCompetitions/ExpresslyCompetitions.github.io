section1-content: "<p>Sí is an album about heart and soul, positivity and family,\
  \ melody and magic. And for that reason, Bocelli chose the strong, simple title.\
  \ “In this historical period we are going through right now, we too often say no.\
  \ But yes is the word you say when you have your first kiss, when you agree with\
  \ somebody, when you want to make someone feel good. Sí is the word you say every\
  \ time things will end well. For a thousand and one reasons, sí is the expression\
  \ of a positive, powerful, human word and feeling and emotion!</p>\r\n<p>Enter below\
  \ for a chance to win Andrea Bocelli ‘Sí’ album and enjoy his beautiful voice.</p>"
