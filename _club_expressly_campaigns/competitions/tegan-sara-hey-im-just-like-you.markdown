section1-content: "<p>’Hey, I’m Just Like You’ is a return to Tegan and Sara’s rock\
  \ and punk roots, with a punch of pop production. Recorded in Vancouver, Canada\
  \ in April and May 2019, the album recasts the remarkable innate songwriting talents\
  \ both possessed as teenagers, and allows these previously unreleased songs to benefit\
  \ from the studio expertise they have gained in the past two decades – a period\
  \ that has seen them release eight studio albums, earning seven Gold certifications\
  \ and one Double Platinum certification in the process. Defiant and melodramatic,\
  \ the songs capture the exultation and grief of first loves, first losses, ecstatic\
  \ kiss-offs, and psychedelic tributes to friendship.</p>\n<p>Click below for a chance\
  \ to win.</p>\n"
