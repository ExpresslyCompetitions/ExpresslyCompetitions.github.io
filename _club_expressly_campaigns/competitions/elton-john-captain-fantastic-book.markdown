section1-content: "<p>In the 1970s, Elton John achieved vertical take-off, quickly\
  \ becoming the biggest international rock phenomenon since The Beatles. But behind\
  \ the comedy glasses and outré image lay a desperately shy individual conflicted\
  \ by his complex relationship with success, his sexuality and his narcotic indulgences.</p>\n\
  <p>Captain Fantastic is based on one-to-one interviews with the star and his associates\
  \ and transports the reader directly into the era, with a supporting cast including\
  \ John Lennon, Stevie Wonder, Bob Dylan, Mae West, Groucho Marx, Katharine Hepburn,\
  \ Elvis Presley, Princess Margaret . . . and The Queen.</p>\n<p>Bringing this head-spinning\
  \ period vividly to life, it follows the skyscraping achievements and plummeting\
  \ lows of Elton s 1970s, from the height of his stacked heels to the depths of his\
  \ depressions. It is the compelling tale of the bashful kid who turned into a superhero.\
