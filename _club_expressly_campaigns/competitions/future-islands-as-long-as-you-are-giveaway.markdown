section1-content: "<p>’As Long As You Are’ is the sixth studio album by The Baltimore\
  \ band Future Islands. It signals a new era for Future Islands. Drummer Mike Lowry\
  \ officially joins as a fully-fledged member and songwriter bolstering the founding\
  \ trio of William Cashion, Samuel T. Herring and Gerrit Welmers. Together, the four-piece\
  \ took on official production duties for the first time, co-producing ‘As Long As\
  \ You Are’ with engineer Steve Wright at his Wrightway Studios in Baltimore. Their\
  \ brand of new wave synth-pop full of bright melodies and heavenly choruses is as\
  \ euphoric and uninhibitedly joyful as anything the band has done in their 14-year\
  \ career. \n</p>\n<p>Click below and it could be yours.</p>\n"
