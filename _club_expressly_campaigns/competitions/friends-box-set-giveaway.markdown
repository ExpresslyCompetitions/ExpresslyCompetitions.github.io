  \ Joey (Matt LeBlanc), Ross (David Schwimmer), and Chandler (Matthew Perry) who\
  \ occupied a trendy New York loft apartment.</p>\r\n<p>From early on it was clear\
  \ that Friends had successfully tapped into the zeitgeist of its time, and now,\
  \ 10 series down the line, the show's broad appeal continues to live on in popular\
  \ culture. This box set contains every episode from season 1 to 10.</p>\r\n<p>Want\
