section1-content: "<p>This amazing perfume scent seizes the attention with a flamboyant\
  \ opening born of the natural rush that is mandarin--imbued with a modish transparency--shimmering\
  \ alongside an audacious fist of pink pepper. The middle notes are an alluring concoction\
  \ of heady lilac and geranium, laced with the succulent tactility of peach--all\
  \ velvet femininity with a beguiling hint of provocation.</p>\n<p>The patchouli\
  \ that is the hallmark of Gucci fragrances here conveys a message of strength, while\
  \ the voluptuousness of amber suggests deep femininity. The effect is at once arresting\
  \ and compellingly seductive. Frida Gianinni observes: ‘What we have created in\
  \ Gucci Guilty is something hypnotic’.</p>\n"
