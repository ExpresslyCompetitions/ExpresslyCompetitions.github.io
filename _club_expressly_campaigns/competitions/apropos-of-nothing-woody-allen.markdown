section1-content: "<p>In this candid and often hilarious memoir, the celebrated director,\
  \ comedian, writer, and actor offers a comprehensive, personal look at his tumultuous\
  \ life. Beginning with his Brooklyn childhood and his stint as a writer for the\
  \ Sid Caesar variety show in the early days of television, working alongside comedy\
  \ greats, Allen tells of his difficult early days doing standup before he achieved\
  \ recognition and success.</p>\n<p>With his unique storytelling pizzazz, he recounts\
  \ his departure into moviemaking, with such slapstick comedies as Take the Money\
  \ and Run, and revisits his entire, sixty-year-long, and enormously productive career\
  \ as a writer and director, from his classics Annie Hall, Manhattan, and Annie and\
  \ Her Sisters to his most recent films, including Midnight in Paris.</p>\n<p>Along\
  \ the way, he discusses his marriages, his romances and famous friendships, his\
  \ jazz playing, and his books and plays. We learn about his demons, his mistakes,\
  \ his successes, and those he loved, worked with, and learned from in equal measure.\
  \ This is hugely entertaining, deeply honest, rich and brilliant self-portrait of\
  \ a celebrated artist who is ranked among the greatest filmmakers of our time.</p>\n"
