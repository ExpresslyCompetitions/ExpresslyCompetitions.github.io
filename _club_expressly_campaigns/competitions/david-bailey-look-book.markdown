  fashion photography\_in the 1960s and made stars of models such as Jean Shrimpton.\
  \ He was also among the first photographers to become a celebrity in his own right,\
  \ socialising with and photographing many of the cultural icons of the 1960s and\
  \ 1970s, such as Catherine Deneuve, The Beatles, Rolling Stones,\_Michael Caine\
  \ and Andy Warhol.</p>\n<p>He has held contracts with British, American and Italian\
  \ Vogue and contributed to many other major magazines and newspapers over more than\

  \ career, Bailey has produced books, paintings, commercials, documentaries and feature\
  \ films and remains a high profile figure in photography and filmmaking.</p>\n<p>This\
