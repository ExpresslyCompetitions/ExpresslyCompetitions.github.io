  \ and unleashing songs which sound bigger, bolder, and more complex than anything\
  \ they have done before. Here, they double down on what, precisely, makes them so\
  \ special, the bright melodies betraying heartbreaking themes of isolation and betrayal,\
  \ the empowering, don’t mess with us all-girl gang glow - while going even further.</p>\n\
