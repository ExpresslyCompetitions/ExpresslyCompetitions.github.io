section1-content: "<p>In this gripping social history, Chinn shines a light on the\
  \ rarely reported struggles of the working class in one of the great cities of the\
  \ British Empire before the First World War. The story continues after 1918 as some\
  \ Peaky Blinders transformed into the infamous Birmingham Gang. Led by the real\
  \ Billy Kimber, they fought a bloody war with the London gangsters Darby Sabini\
  \ and Alfie Solomon over valuable protection rackets extorting money from bookmakers\
  \ across the booming postwar racecourses of Britain.</p>\n<p>Drawing together a\
  \ remarkably wide-range of original sources, including rarely seen images of real\
  \ Peaky Blinders and interviews with relatives of the 1920s gangsters, Peaky Blinders:\
  \ The Real Story adds a new dimension to the true history of Birmingham's underworld\
  \ and fact behind its fiction.</p>\n"
