  \ and the societal pressures and expectations that come with that. Jovial and playful\
  \ at times, unblinkingly daring at others.</p>\n<p>The album is bursting with Shah’\
  s beloved personality while simultaneously refusing to compromise on the social\
  \ commentary that she continues to deliver so fearlessly.</p>\n"
