  <p>The Breville VTP130 Traditional Crêpe Maker is a 30 centimetre (cm) wide circular\
  \ cooking plate made from aluminium with a non-stick coating for easy cleaning.\
  \ In fact, there's no fiddly dismantling required to wash the plate after use, simply\
  \ wipe clean with a damp cloth and it's ready to use again. It boosts an impressive\
  \ 1000 kW of power and has a variable temperature control with five settings, giving\
  \ you the control to heat to your requirements. The plate rapidly heats up and after\
  \ less than three minutes is ready to go at a medium setting.</p>\n"
