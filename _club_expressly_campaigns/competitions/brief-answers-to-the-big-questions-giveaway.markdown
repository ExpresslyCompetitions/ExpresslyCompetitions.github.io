section1-content: "<p>The world-famous cosmologist and #1 bestselling author of A\
  \ Brief History of Time leaves us with his final thoughts on the universe's biggest\
  \ questions in this brilliant posthumous work.</p>\n<p>Throughout his extraordinary\
  \ career, Stephen Hawking expanded our understanding of the universe and unravelled\
  \ some of its greatest mysteries. But even as his theoretical work on black holes,\
  \ imaginary time and multiple histories took his mind to the furthest reaches of\
  \ space, Hawking always believed that science could also be used to fix the problems\
  \ on our planet.</p>\n<p>And now, as we face potentially catastrophic changes here\
  \ on Earth - from climate change to dwindling natural resources to the threat of\
  \ artificial super-intelligence - Stephen Hawking turns his attention to the most\
  \ urgent issues for humankind.</p>\nWide-ranging, intellectually stimulating, passionately\
  \ argued, and infused with his characteristic humour, Brief answers to the Big Questions,\
  \ the final book from one of the greatest minds in history, is a personal view on\
  \ the challenges we face as a human race, and where we, as a planet, are heading\
  \ next.</p>\n"
