section1-content: "<p>Jeff Lynne’s ELO, whose music has touched fans deeply across\
  \ three generations now, has found himself in recent years at the peak of his powers\
  \ as a songwriter, musician and producer. The forthcoming album features a buoyant\
  \ title song which opens the ten-track record including the wistful “Help Yourself”\
  \ to the celebratory “Down Came the Rain” to the churning rocker “One More Time”\
  \ to the sweet closer, “Songbird.”</p>\n<p>’From Out of Nowhere’ shows Lynne finding\
  \ new facets to his signature sound, at once drawing on his globally loved legacy\
  \ and forging new paths in both sounds and emotions. Once again, he plays nearly\
  \ every note of the music on guitars, bass, piano, drums, keyboards and vibes, as\
  \ well as singing all of the lead and layered harmony vocals.</p>\n<p>Click below\
