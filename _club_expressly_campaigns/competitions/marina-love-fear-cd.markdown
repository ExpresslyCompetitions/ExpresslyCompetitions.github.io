section1-content: "<p>Marina used her break as a period of reflection and to rediscover\
  \ her authentic self, as opposed to the artist and persona she had lived and breathed\
  \ since signing her record deal at the age of 22.</p>\n<p>She says that her album\
  \ ‘‘LOVE is filled with a longing to enjoy life and a desire for unity. FEAR explores\
  \ subjects that have been a lot harder for me to work through and understand, such\
  \ as purpose insecurity in love, and major shifts in our social conscience regarding\
  \ the systematic misogyny and sexual abuse employed by powerful figures in the media.\
  \ A companion to LOVE, these ideas cross to showcase and explore the polarising\
  \ sides of human nature’’.</p>\n<p>If you can’t wait to hear her brand new hits,\
  \ enter the form below for a chance to win and get ready to enjoy her incredible\
  \ voice now.</p>\n"
