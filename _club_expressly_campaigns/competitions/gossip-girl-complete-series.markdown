  \ Upper East Side's most notorious party girl, is back in town the way they learn\

  \ ultra-secretive Gossip Girl. No one knows Gossip Girl's identity, but everyone\
  \ in this exclusive and complicated vicious circle relies on her website and text\
  \ messages for the latest scoop. Even Serena's closest friend, Blair Waldorf, is\
  \ surprised to find that Serena has suddenly ended her self-imposed exile to boarding\
  \ school and returned to Manhattan.</p>\n<p>Keeping track of the shifting friendships,\
  \ jealousies and turmoil in this wealthy and complex world isn't easy, but it's\
  \ what Gossip Girl does best.</p>\n"
