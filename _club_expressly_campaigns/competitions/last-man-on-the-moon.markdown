  \ story of fulfilment, love and loss.</p>\r\n<p>Five years in the making, the documentary\

  \ go.</p>\r\n<p>The film features exclusive interviews with former astronauts, such\
  \ as Apollo 12 crew-members Alan Bean and Dick Gordon and Apollo 13 Commander Jim\
  \ Lovell, as well as NASA Flight Director Gene Kranz and Director of Flight Operations\
