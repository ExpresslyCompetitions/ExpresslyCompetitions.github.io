  \ twilight into sound.</p>\n<p>He describes his new album as: ‘‘A depiction of isolation.\
  \ Of the past. Of an uncertain future. Of provisions. Of an omen. Of a dead deer.\
  \ Of an icon. Of a Los Angeles themed hotel in rural Kansas. Of billowing campfires,\
  \ a mermaid and a highway lined in rabbit fur. It is a depiction of the nervous\
  \ feeling that comes with the sky's proud announcement that another day will be\
  \ soon coming to a close as the pink light recedes and the street lamps and house\
  \ lights suddenly click on.’’</p>\n<p>Click below for a chance to win.</p>\n"
